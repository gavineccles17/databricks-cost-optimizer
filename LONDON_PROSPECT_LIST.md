# London Databricks Prospect List - Week 1 Targets

## Overview
Curated list of mid-size London tech companies using Databricks. Focused on 15-150 person engineering teams where a single $10-20K/year waste = meaningful impact.

---

## Tier 1: Fintech (Highest Priority)

### Checkout.com
- **Size:** 700+ employees, £30B valuation
- **Why:** Enterprise payments + data analytics core to business
- **Contact Titles:** Director of Data Engineering, VP Analytics, Senior Data Engineer
- **LinkedIn Search:** `Checkout.com AND "Data Engineer" OR "Analytics" -CEO -VP -Sales`
- **Notes:** Series D backed, funding means spend accountability. Payment systems = high DBU usage
- **Approach:** "Your payment transaction data could be telling you 40% of customers are costing you money to process"

### OakNorth
- **Size:** 150-200 employees (smaller, more agile)
- **Why:** Banking/lending = obsessed with risk/cost metrics
- **Contact Titles:** Head of Data, Senior Analytics Engineer, Data Scientist

- **Approach:** "We help European banks reduce their data warehouse spend by 35% without losing rigor"

### Tide

## Tier 2: E-Commerce & Logistics (Secondary Priority)

### Vinted
- **Size:** 800+ employees (maybe too large... but try smaller divisions)
- **Why:** Marketplace = transaction data everywhere

- **Contact Titles:** Senior Analytics Engineer, Data Ops Manager, Analytics Manager
- **LinkedIn Search:** `Farfetch AND London AND "Analytics" OR "Data Engineer"`
- **Notes:** Public company = cost controls exist. Find individual contributors in London, not headquarters stakeholders

## Outreach Sequence (This Week Plan)

### Monday - Wednesday: Tier 1 Fintech (5-7 people per company)
**Pick companies:** Checkout.com, OakNorth, Tide
**Task:** Find 2 "Director/VP of Data" + 2 "Senior Data Engineer" at each company
**Send:** Use Template 1 (Problem-First) from LINKEDIN_SALES_COPY.md adapted with company-specific pain
**Expected commitment:** 15 minutes profile research + 2 minutes per message write = 25 min total / day

### Thursday - Friday: Fintech Follow-ups + Early E-commerce
**Pick:** 1-2 people from Curve, Ably (fintech adjacent)
**Send:** Template 1 again with different angle
**Then:** 2-3 Vinted/Gousto people with e-commerce angle
**Total:** Another 15 messages this week = ~50 total sent

### Tracking
- Create Google Sheet with columns: Company | Name | Title | LinkedIn URL | Date Sent | Template | Response | Next Step
- Check for responses daily
- Expect 5-10% response rate (0-2 responses this week is normal)

## LinkedIn Search Syntax (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Fintech Data Roles (Checkout.com):**
```
checkout.com AND ("Director of Data" OR "VP Engineering" OR "Head of Data" OR "Senior Data Engineer") 
```

```
(OakNorth OR Tide OR Curve OR Ably) AND ("Data Engineer" OR "Analytics" OR "DB" OR "Warehouse")
```

**E-Commerce Data:**

(Vinted OR Gousto OR Farfetch OR Trustpilot) AND ("Data Engineer" OR "Analytics Engineer" OR "Principal Data") 
```

---

## Message Customization Tips

1. **Checkout.com:** Focus on payment data = transaction cost optimization
2. **OakNorth:** Emphasize lending risk + regulatory compliance in data systems
3. **Tide:** Mention you're both UK-based founders
4. **Curve:** Card data specificity = real-time transaction processing
5. **Vinted/Gousto:** Marketplace/logistics = rapid iteration = data cost hidden in velocity

---

## Red Flags (Skip These People)

- ❌ "AI" or "ML" in title only (non-technical buyers, wrong buyer)
- ❌ Sales Engineer or Solutions Architect (they don't control budgets)
- ❌ Anyone with "Chief" or "EVP" in title (too senior, too slow)
- ❌ Recently posted "celebrating our cost reduction" (already did this)
- ❌ Company that just raised funding and says "we're focused on growth not cost" (wrong mindset)

---

## Success Metrics for This Week

- **Target:** Send 50 LinkedIn messages (7-8 per day)
- **Target:** 3-5 responses (5-10% rate is normal)
- **Goal:** 1-2 intro calls scheduled for next week
- **Measure:** Response rate + quality of conversations started

---

## Next Steps After Week 1

1. **Analyze responses:** Which message template worked best? (Track in sheet)
2. **Iterate:** Top-performing template gets scaled next week (100+ messages)
3. **First call:** Prepare 15-min intro script: "Tell me about your current data setup" → listen → offer free 1-hour audit
4. **Free audit process:** If they say yes → get credentials → run Docker → deliver report in 24 hours
